This summer, I spent my holidays at the seaside. I went there with my family. We stayed in a small hotel near the beach. Every morning, I went swimming in the sea. 
The water was warm and clean. I also enjoyed sunbathing and relaxing on the sand. My little sister built sandcastles every day. 
Sometimes we played beach volleyball with other tourists. In the evenings, we walked along the coast and watched the sunset. We also visited some local markets. 
I bought souvenirs for my friends and relatives. We tried delicious seafood at restaurants. One day, we went on a boat trip. I saw dolphins swimming near the boat. 
That was amazing and unforgettable. I took a lot of photos during the holiday. The weather was perfect the whole time. I also read two books while I was there. 
I made some new friends at the hotel. We played games and talked in the evenings. It was a great holiday, and I hope to go back next year.

I study at a secondary school in my city. I usually go to school five days a week. My school starts at 8:30 in the morning. I have six lessons every day. 
My favorite subjects are English and History. I also like Art and Physical Education. Our teachers are friendly and helpful. They always try to make lessons interesting. 
During breaks, I talk with my classmates. We sometimes play games or go outside. At 2:30 p.m., school finishes and I go home. After lunch, I usually do my homework. 
Sometimes it takes me two hours to complete it. I always try to finish it on time. In the evenings, I relax or read books. 
On Fridays, we sometimes have school events or clubs. I’m part of the drama club, and we prepare performances. We once performed a comedy play for our school. 
Everyone laughed and clapped loudly. School is not always easy, but I like learning new things. I enjoy being with my friends and learning every day.

My favorite animal is the dog. Dogs are friendly and loyal pets. They can understand people’s emotions. I have a dog at home. His name is Max. He is a golden retriever. 
Max is very playful and energetic. He loves running in the park and chasing balls. Every morning, I take him for a walk. He gets very excited when he sees his leash. 
Max also knows some tricks, like sit, stay, and paw. He always comes when I call him. He is good with children and other animals. Sometimes he sleeps on my bed at night. 
I take care of him every day. I give him food, clean water, and brush his fur. Max is part of our family. We take him on trips with us. He loves riding in the car. 
Dogs make people happy. That’s why they are my favorite animals.

In the future, I want to become a doctor. I have always wanted to help people. Doctors save lives and make people feel better. It’s not an easy job, but it’s very important. 
I need to study hard to achieve this goal. Science and biology are my favorite subjects. I want to study at a good medical university. My parents support my dream. 
They believe I can do it. I want to work in a big hospital. I also hope to travel and help people in poor countries. Being a doctor means always learning. 
New diseases appear, and doctors must stay prepared. I also want to be kind and listen to my patients. Helping others brings me happiness. I know it takes time and effort. 
But I am ready to work hard. I want to make a difference in people’s lives. My dream job will let me do that. I will do my best to make this dream come true.

Last year, I had a very special day. It was my birthday. I turned 15 years old. My parents planned a surprise party for me. I didn’t know anything about it. 
When I came home from school, all my friends were there. They shouted, “Surprise!” and I was so happy. The house was full of balloons and decorations. 
There was a big chocolate cake with candles. Everyone sang the birthday song. We played games, danced, and took funny photos. I got many great presents. 
My favorite gift was a smartwatch from my parents. My best friend gave me a handmade bracelet. It was so thoughtful and beautiful. We ate pizza, chips, and drank juice. 
I laughed the whole evening. We watched a funny movie together. Some friends stayed late to talk. It was the best birthday I’ve ever had. I will always remember that day.
